# VCS Realtime SDK sample application for web clients

This sample application uses the [Virtual Care Service (VCS) Realtime JavaScript SDK](https://sdk.virtualcareservices.net/) to demonstrate how users use join virtual rooms to interact with audio and/or video.

The application has two parts:

1. **Application server**: The application server is a Node.js app that serves two purposes, a) serve the frontend Vue.js application, and b) create rooms on behalf of the frontend application using the [VCS REST API](https://sdk.virtualcareservices.net/sdks/rest/).
2. **Frontend Vue app**: The frontend app uses the [VCS Realtime JavaScript SDK](https://sdk.virtualcareservices.net/) to join the virtual room. Peer-2-peer WebRTC is used for media communication.

> At this time only four participants can join a room

## Running application locally

### Getting the code

Clone this repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ATOS-VIRTUAL-CARE/vcs-realtime-sdk-web-demo
cd vcs-realtime-sdk-web-demo
npm install
```

### Configure the app

#### Application server

Contact the system administrator of your VCS system to obtain a VCS API key and the domain of the VCS system. Set the following environment variables to adapt.

```
# VCS API KEY used to create room via REST API
export VCS_API_KEY=04gf...

# VCS server, e.g. sandbox.virtualcareservices.net
export VCS_HOST=sandbox.virtualcareservices.net

# PORT express app is listening on. Default is port 3001.
export VCS_PORT=3001
```

#### Frontend Vue app

Set the `VITE_APP_SERVER` parameter in file `/frontend/.env` to `http://localhost:3001`. This tells your web app where the Application server is hosted at.

E.g.:

```env
# So in development set to localhost:3001 for example
VITE_APP_SERVER=http://localhost:3001
```

### Start the app

There are no other dependencies to run the app locally. Once you add the API key as explained above, start the backend and frontend. The application is available at <http://localhost:3000/>.

```bash
# Start the backend application server and frontend Vue app (default port 3000)
npm run dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
```

### HTTPS

In some cases you might want to serve the backend via HTTPS so that external devices can easier connect to the backend. And you may also want to serve the frontend on https for camera access reasons.

#### Serve backend on https

In the backend `.env` file uncomment HTTPS and set certificate and private key file names. These files should be added to the `backend/cert` folder.

backend `.env` file:

```env
# Serve as HTTPS for development with mobile devices.
# Make sure to use https setting in frontend when setting HTTPS=true here
HTTPS=true
CERT_FILE=tls.crt
KEY_FILE=tls.key
```

In the fontend `.env` file make sure to use https for VITE_APP_SERVER.

frontend `.env` file:

```env
VITE_APP_SERVER=https://localhost:3001
```

#### Serve frontend on https

To serve the frontend on https, run the app via `npm run dev:https` instead.

### Authentication

By default there is no authentication required to access the `POST /room` endpoint to create rooms. Basic Authentication can be configured in the backend and frontend env files. Set the backend env property `AUTH_TYPE`to `BASIC_AUTH`, and then configure the credentials of a user that has permissions to create rooms via env properties `BASIC_AUTH_USER` & `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`.
